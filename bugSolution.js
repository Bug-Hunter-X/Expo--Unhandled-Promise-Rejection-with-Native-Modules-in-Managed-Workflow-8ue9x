Several approaches can resolve this. The most suitable one depends on the specific native module involved.

**1. Using an Expo-compatible alternative:**

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; // Use Expo's Camera API

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Camera</Text>
      <Camera />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Replace the incompatible native module with an Expo-compatible one. Expo often provides wrappers or alternatives for commonly used native modules.

**2. Ejecting to Bare Workflow (Advanced):**

If no Expo alternative exists and the native module is crucial, consider ejecting to the bare workflow. This allows for more direct native module integration but increases complexity.

**3.  SDK Version Check and Compatibility:** Verify that your Expo SDK version is aligned with the native module's requirements; an incompatibility can lead to such errors.

**4. Robust Error Handling:**

Wrap your native module interactions with error handling:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
// ... other imports

export default function App() {
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);

  const useCamera = async () => {
    try {
      // ... use camera code ... 
    } catch (e) {
      setError(e);
    }
  }
  // ... rest of the code ... 
}
```
By implementing comprehensive error handling, you will identify the root cause and fix the issue effectively.
