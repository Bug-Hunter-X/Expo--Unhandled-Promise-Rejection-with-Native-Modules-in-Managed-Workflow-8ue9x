This error typically occurs when using Expo's managed workflow and attempting to use a native module that isn't compatible with Expo's managed workflow, or when there is a mismatch between your Expo SDK version and the native module's requirements.  Here's a code snippet demonstrating a potential scenario:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; // Assume this is incompatible

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Camera</Text>
      <Camera />
    </View>
  );
}
```

This might work fine with some modules, but others may throw "Unhandled promise rejection" or similar errors during the build process or runtime if the module has native dependencies Expo Go or the managed workflow can't handle.
